# run_analysis
Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This is the final project of the course. Submited by Carlos Diaz.
The objective is to create a tidy data
It cointains three files: README.MD, CodeBook, and run_analysis.R
    Readme.MD >> Resumes the project
    CodeBook.MD >> Descrives the data and variables
    run_analysis.R >>> tidy the data set in five steps:
      1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
      2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
      3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
      4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
      5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and            each subject.
